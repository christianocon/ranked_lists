Since we were children, we’ve all had a favorite something. Favorite color, favorite dinosaur, favorite food. And for all my life I’ve loved discussing my favorites with friends. Which Star Wars movie is best (Empire)? What’s the best taco shop in San Diego? Who’s the most fun NBA player to watch any given year? And, as a way to help me sort out my own picks, I’ve always enjoyed making lists and using them to rank and re-rank my choices. And I’ve found that surprising upsets can occur when I put two items side by side that I never forced myself to choose between before. That is the basis for what this site will be.


This site (clever name pending) will make it easy for people to either enter in lists of things they’d like to rank or jump in on the debate over existing lists. It’d be a semi social place for people to get to the bottom of such important questions as “what actually are my top 5 favorite foods?” or “who is the ultimate 80s action star?” And they can do so in as public or private a way as they’d like. I know that I make these lists for myself sometimes, but I hope that some people might see a featured list and not be able to help joining in on the sitewide debate.


Although users will be able to use this website whether or not they create an account, in order to save their own personal lists (or their own takes on public lists) long term, they will need to register for an account. From there they will be able to create lists or modify existing ones and either tie them to their account privately or share them publicly. 


I referred to this site as “semi social” because I do not envision actual comments space (though this is subject to change). I’d like the site to remain purely about creating your own lists, or weighing in on public lists which will display “standings” reflecting the aggregate choices made by the site’s users on its public lists. 
Administrators will exist in order to monitor content of public lists; however private lists will remain exactly that. Since user-generated public lists will come from specific users, administrators will be able to see repeat offenders and have the ability to disable accounts.
